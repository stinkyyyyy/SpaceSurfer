## TL;DR; (For the Zoomers and ADHD people out there)

You want to find some HuggingFace Spaces, but you're too lazy to, you know, *actually look*?  This abomination of code lets you do just that.  It's like Tinder, but for AI demos, and instead of disappointment, you get... well, probably also disappointment, but at least it's *AI-powered* disappointment.

We've got:

*   **Filters:**  who has time to scroll through *all* the garbage?  Filter by category, Space type, SDK... you know, the usual suspects.
*   **Swiping:**  Yeah, we ripped off Tinder.  Sue us.  Swipe right if you like it (you won't), swipe left if you hate it (you will).
*   **History:**  A chronological record of your poor life choices.  Revisit the Spaces you *thought* were cool, only to realize they were just as stinky as the rest.
*   **Dark Mode:**  staring at a bright screen is for normies.
* **A fuckton of UI components:** Thanks to the magic of `shadcn/ui`, we have more components that anyone needs, behold the sheer unoriginality.

## Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:**
    *   React (everyone else is doing it)
    *   Vite (it's fast, or so they say)
    *   Tailwind CSS (writing CSS is for masochists)
    *   shadcn/ui (we're too busy to design our own components)
    *   React Query (for fetching data and caching, we're not *completely* incompetent)
    *   Wouter (React Router is too mainstream)
    *   Framer Motion (for animations to distract you from the shitty code)

*   **Backend:**
    *   Express (it's the least worst option)
    *   Drizzle ORM (too scared to write raw SQL)
    *   Zod (for validation, we don't trust ourselves)
    *   Neon (serverless)
* **Deployment:**
	* Replit (it's free and easy, like me.)

## Getting Started (Good Luck, You'll Need It)

1.  **Clone the repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/stinkyyyyy/SpaceSurfer
    ```
    (You did fork it first, right? ... Right?)

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd stinkyyyyy-spacesurfer
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Create a `.env` file:**.
   You'll need a `DATABASE_URL` for your Postgres database (if you're not running it on replit). Good luck figuring that out.

4.  **Run the dev server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start both the front-end and back-end dev servers.

5. **Build and start:**
	```bash
	npm run build
	npm run start
	```
